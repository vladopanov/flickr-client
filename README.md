# flickr-client

First of all I want to mention that this project is a very good starting point for a fresh start of any React client.
It is very simple to start the app locally (http://localhost:3000/), just in 2 steps:
1. From the root directory of the project run 'npm install' in order to install the node packages. Of course you should have Node.js installed.
2. Start the project by entering 'npm start'.

Generally, the starting point is index.tsx in /src. There we have an App() instance which starts all the dependencies (services, stores, utilities). The app is developed using React, TypeScript and MobX (https://mobx.js.org) as a state management solution.

# Tests
In order to start the tests just run 'npm test'.
